# Hi! I am Peter



### karo.io - info about the creator of www.karopapier.de
Since the dawn of the internet, I have been working on my personal project [www.karopapier.de](https://www.karopapier.de) (an online/browser implementation of the vector based [racetrack game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racetrack_(game))).

The game features code from the past two decades, from an old php3 forum to realtime websocket push notifications and a Single Page App for playing - and it helped me to experiment with the hot stuff every year.

Even though it has the look of the '90s (&lt;FRAMESET&gt; FTW!!!), there's more modern stuff under the hood than you might think...
  
### Find me!
Since my twitter handle [@xosofox](https://twitter.com/xosofox) is impossible to pronounce, I will use this entry point for others to find me more easily.

### XOSOFOX?
Why do I have this strange handle anyway?? Well, it's because **XOSOFOX** looks like this ![Image](https://www.karopapier.de/map/105.png?size=12&border=1&cps=0) when it is interpreted as playable map code on www.karopapier.de
